Storage for static site files I've uploaded to yay.boo

I've decided to archive the any files for static sites I've uploaded to yay.boo here, in case I want to recreate them. Each set of files should be in it's own sub-folder named after the yay.boo site it was/is uploaded to, with a cooresponding readme saying how it was generated.
