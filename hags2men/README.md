# hags2men

Little static random link generator site written for July 2024 issue of Just2Hags. I gave it a very stupid name.

[hags2men - roll the dice!](http://hags2men.yay.boo)

I made this by creating the page on a branch of my personal site repo, using flask and jinja, then making it static using flask-freeze. There's also
some javascript included.

link-peek.js is an edited version of [link-peek](https://darn.es/link-peek-web-component/). The edits mean the link being previewed can be updated dynamically
using javascript.

Styling is based on [magic.css](https://css.winterveil.net/) and the colour scheme & font of [moku.blog](https://moku.blog/).
